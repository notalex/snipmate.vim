h2. snipmate.vim

bq. snipmate.vim is simple plugin to provide snippets in Vim. To add custom snippets, simply check a file in the snippets/ folder and follow the pattern. Snippets for a particular language are all bundled in a single file. For example, all *ruby* snippets are inside *snippets/ruby.snippets*. *html.erb* snippets are an exception to this rule. They  will be found under the snippets/eruby/ folder

This fork was made to add more snippets, mainly for Ruby.

h4. Installation

bq. If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend using "Vundle":https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

With Vundle, you can simply add *Bundle 'notalex/snipmate.vim'* to your *.vimrc* and run

bc. :BundleInstall
